            * This section of the context model was recently added from within a personal outline of selected community concepts. It's currently peppered with my own commentary, in outline callouts. The community concepts model should soon be updated towards a more normative form, now that it would be included in the formal Context Model for the Gazebo Hub Project

                                * Strengths in the participant base
                                * Diversity in networks
                                    * I'll add: Stability in networks
                                * Citizen involvement in defining, understanding, and completing goals
                                    * I'll add: Community goals setting should be community driven, in a democratic society
                            * Leadership
                                * Formal and informal leaders should be included
                                * Leadership provides some sense of direction and structure
                                    * I'll add: Leadership brings its own experiences to the table. Furthermore, it should be emphasized as a matter of, by, and for the people, not per se for the agendas of community leadership if apart from the goals of the community
                                * Leadership must encourage participation from and within the diverse community base
                                    * Procedures may be implemented (insofar as developed) to endeavor to ensure (and support) an inclusive mode of participation during group meetings and events
                                        * I'll add: But try not to  make it like a dog and pony show, of structure devoid of substantive meaning and understanding
                                * Leadership must assist in sharing information about resources among community and organizational participants
                                * Must assist in developing new leaders
                                * Must be responsive and accessible in demeanor
                                * Not disconnected from other leaders
                        * Skills
                            * The authors seem to propose a rather formal approach to community activity, in terms of skills - no doubt, an approach influenced with paradigms of social policy work.   
                                
                              Experience may hold that a less formal, less bureaucratic approach may ultimately serve to be more adaptive and more sincerely effective, in addressing community needs, goals, and community life overall, with available, material resources.   
                                
                              Perhaps an informal approach, as such, may serve to augment the necessarily formalized approaches of social policy workers
                        * Resources
                            * May be internal or external to a community, as resources
                            * Resource sharing, in the community
                            * Social capital
                                * Trust
                                * Confidence
                                * Cooperation
                        * Social and Interorganizational Networks
                            * Reciprocal links
                            * Frequency of supportive interactions
                            * Overlap, among community networks
                                * May exist as social, pragmatic, and/or conceptual overlap, for instance
                            * Members able to form new associations
                                * A democratic structure for community, not oligarchical
                            * Cooperative decision-making
                        * Sense of Community
                            * Concern for community issues
                                * Must be predicated with an understanding of community issues
                            * Respect
                            * Generosity
                            * Selflessness
                            * Connectedness with place and people

                                * This one is listed in [Goodman1998] table 1  
                                    
                                  It needs more exposition than in table 1 - refer to later sections of the paper
                        * Understanding of Community History
                            * Recent and historic social, political, and economic changes
                            * Knowledge of organizations, community groups, and community sections
                                * The community may endeavor to ensure that community leadership would not displace selected groups, if by way of negligence and alternate focus
                            * Community relations to other communities
                        * Community Power
                            * Positions in regards to dynamics of change - to create, support or resist change - in regards to community resources, community interests (and goals), and community experiences
                            * Mutual power, not controlling power
                                * Avoid "zero sum" strategies
                            * Diversity of influences
                        * Community Values
                            * Consensus building
                            * "Norms, standards, and attributes"
                                * This concept may support a risk, however, of introducing private agendas in endeavoring to override community interests
                        * Critical Reflection
                            * Reflection on assumptions about ideas and actions
                            * Logical reasoning  and scrutiny in regards to ambiguity in community discussions
                                * This may entail a sense of patience and of clarity, in regards to difficulties in communication and mutual understanding of ideas
                            * Understanding pressures of environmental influence on individual and social behavior
                                * This may call for a sense of caring objectivity, about environmental influences - even in regards to negative trends in a community, trends such as of youth gangs, violence, aggression, drug use, sexual abuse, homelessness, poverty, and overall difficulty in overcoming the negative influences of the diaspora, in personal and family life. while (for instance) proceeding through school, individually and within the community, and in living in professional and family life, overall.

            * To do: Gazebo Hub Project Modeling (PM) Ontology  
                
              Model the concept of a "work area" with an additional OWL class, in a project modeling ontology, such that would import the Gazebo Hub CM ontology  
                
              Extend that "work area" class and its data model instance, "Economic analysis," with properties associating a work area with developer resources  such as: Repository and module path; Wiki; Tickets. Also define a class, "Project," in that ontology, and consider integrating the ontology with emForge.  
                
              Note that a "Work area" may be informally like a module, whether or not discretely integrating with a containing system. A work area provides, simply, a context for further development of resources within a project.  
                
              The class, "Milestone," would extend, "Work Area"  
                
              The PM ontology may also define a class, "Roadmap"
                * This, in turn, may serve to suggest the development of some new project management tooling, incorporating data models based on the PM ontology
                    * The Gazebo Hub Core Ontologies set should include an ontology for serialization of a permissions model, for use in ontology tooling. To serve a functional purpose, that ontology should also be incorporated with a user authentication model for integration with same tooling,
                        * This model may derive features from SAML  
                            [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_1.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_1.1)
                            * JA-SIG CAS supports using SAML 1.1 for ticket validation requests

                        * it may be wise to consider basing the auth/permissions model and corresponding system on a CAS system

                    * The variety of XML syntaxes presents the opportunity to illustrate the usage of a single mode of informative "derives from" relation, within the context model - as specifically denoting when an application data serialization syntax (such as XMI) derives from a more general data serialization syntax (such as XML) though each respective syntax would be organized within a separate branch of the context model.  
                        
                      Note, furthermore, that in the case of the derivation of XML from SGML, XML also adds features not deriving directly from SGML syntax, such as with XML namespaces.

                              In one exact question: Is it possible to model a BPMN diagram with a UML profile? (A: Yes. The OMG publishes an albeit non-normative UML profile for BPMN, as well as for each of SysML and SOAML)

                * This context area poses a challenge for the single-axial model.   
                    
                  Consider that a SysML profile is both a SysML profile and a UML profile, simultaneously.  
                    
                  It would seem that MOF and UML together form essentially the "backbone" for the modeling components of OMG MDA. As far as the question of whether a diagram tool implementer should select a modeling system's metamodel or respective UML profile for implementation and  support, it would probably be a question of how the modeling tool would be used - whether in a broader sense, with the modeling system's metamodel, or with existing UML tools, as with the respective UML profile.  
                    
                  As far as the question of whether a model system developer would develop a UML profile and/or an MOF metamodel for the diagram system, it may likewise be a question of context of use. A UML profile may support a more simple mode of integration with existing UML modeling tools, whereas an MOF metamodel may require more extensive work for integration with existing modeling tools.  
                    
                  The phrase, "Extends," may be used as a synonym of the phrase, "Derives from," in a similar sense.
